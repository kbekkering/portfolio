# LRNR

LRNR should allow me to practice my german vocab, as well as show that I can build something like this (and learn the stuff that I don't yet know). 

### LRNR
This could be a single-page app that retrieves the library from an API (myjson.com to start with).

The actual app should do the following:
[] practice routine
  [] display a random word, incl. 3 possible translations
  [] correct answer: next word
  [] false answer: tell user and show correct word
  [] score, maybe keeping track of (highest) streak
[] authorization
[] search for specific word in library
